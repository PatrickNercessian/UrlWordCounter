# URL Word Counter

To use Docker:
> docker-compose run --rm urlwordcounter

Use this Python Script to count the number of occurences of each word in a web page.

It can also recursively update the counts with hyperlinks within the web page. This is currently set at a depth of 1 to avoid breaking the internet (more likely your computer)
